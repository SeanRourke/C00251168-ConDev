## Description

##### Demonstration of the dining philosophers problem. Five philosophers dine together at the same table. Each philosopher has their own plate at the table. There is a fork between each plate. The dish has to be eaten with two forks. Each philosopher can only alternately think and eat. A philosopher can only eat their dish when they have both a left and right fork. Thus two forks will only be available when their two nearest neighbors are thinking, not eating. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they will put down both forks.
